Proper prompts and context are an important part of building with AI developer tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). Below are installable rule files and MCP servers that help guide AI to build more optimally with Abstract and AGW Reusables:

## Cursor

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://build.abs.xyz/r/cursor-ai-config.json"
```

## Claude Code

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://build.abs.xyz/r/claude-config.json"
```
